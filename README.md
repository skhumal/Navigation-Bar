During my HTML & CSS course on Udemy, I explored Flexbox, and it completely transformed the way I approach layout design. Unlike traditional methods like float and positioning, Flexbox allowed me to build a structured and flexible project with fewer lines of code, achieving amazing results.

What I Learned:
âœ… Effortless Alignment â€“ Easily positioned and aligned items without extra hacks.
âœ… Directional Control â€“ Changed the flow of items seamlessly.
âœ… Typography & Modern Styling â€“ Experimented with different fonts to enhance visual appeal.

This hands-on experience boosted my confidence and reinforced the importance of working smarter, not harder. It also inspired me to focus on clean and efficient code, ensuring that every styling decision serves a purpose.

Iâ€™m excited to keep improving and applying these concepts in real-world projects! ðŸ’¡
